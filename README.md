### Introduction
This repositiry contains my solutions to the tasks assigned to us throughout the 7th semester module Emerging Technologies, delivered by Dr. Ian McLoughlin. My solutions are in the Python language, through Jupyter-Notebook. The rest of this README will give a quick breakdown of each of the four tasks, a how to run guide and finally my conclusions.  

### Task 1
The goal is to write a python function to calculate and return the square root of 2 to 100 decmial places. We are to achive this without using any of Pythons standard libraries.

### Task 2
The goal is to verify the Chi-squared value from a given table of data, from wikipedia, and calculate the associated 'p' value using `scipy.stats`.

### Task 3
To research, implement and discuss Microsoft Excel's two variations of Standard Deviation calculations, 
* Standard Deviation of an **Entire** Population, STDEV.P
* Standard Deviation of a **Sample** Population, STDEV.S

### Task 4
To apply K-Means Clustering to Fishers Iris Data. This data was developed by Fisher to distinguish between types of the flower Iris.

### How To Guide
#### Prerequisites: 
* Python version 3.7 or greater.
* Jupyter-Notebook, comes with Anaconda,
    * To check, open a command window.
    * Type `jupyter-notebook --version`.
* Network Connection.

#### Clone Repository
* Navigate to [Assesment Repositiory](https://github.com/DarraghLally/Emerging-Tech-Assesments "Darragh's GitHub").
* Clone repository to your machine.

#### Run
* In a command window navigate to the cloned folder.
* Type command `jupyter-notebook`,
    * New browser window will open with my notebook.
* In the tool bar,
    * Select 'Kernal'.
    * Select 'Restart & Run All'.

Each of the notebooks cells will refresh and run the relevent 'code cells'.

### Conclusions
Very enjoyable tasks. Glad to be introduced to Jupyter Notebook, its a really nice tool for this kind of work. I found myself struggling with time for most of the semester, due to a number of factors related to Covid, therefore task 4 is not of the standard I would like to submit. And while I am disapointed in my preformance I feel I have come away with a new understanding of a very relevent language, Python, a great tool in which to implement Python, Jupyter Notebook and more experience in researching problems and implementing solutions.
